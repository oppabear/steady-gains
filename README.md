The problem with investing
==========================

Poor Money management and out of control emotions are the downfall of many investors. A stock rises in value and you get greedy, holding on for more only to see the price fall below its purchase price. Then you get desparate, hoping the stock will rise again, only to see its price decline further. You eventually loose all your trading capital and wallow in self-pitty.

How this can help
=================

The goal of this program is to empower you to make consistent gains in the stock market. It does this by employing money management techniques that remove emotions from your investment decisions. You set your constraints ahead of time, then purchase your stock, and the program will inform you when to sell, how much to sell, and when to adjust your stop loss values. Your potential upside will be reduced since you're locking in profits early, while your downside will be limited.

Caveats
=======
A few warnings should be heeded:

* What this program cannot do is choose quality stocks for you. Whether you see steady gains or a steady decline will depend on the constraints you set and the stocks you select. 

* This program does not automatically buy and sell stocks or adjust your stop loss value; you must carry out the orders it gives you.

* You should avoid second guessing yourself and carry out the instructions as given. You may fine-tune the constraints for your next trading period, but don't make changes in the heat of battle.
